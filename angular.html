      <h1>Angular JS</h1>
      <p>The most popular JS framework from Google</p>
    </Header>
    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>uper easy to start. You just drop in a script tag into your document
          add some ng- attributes to your app and you magically get behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's well-supported by a core team, many of whom are full
          time Google employees.
        </li>
        <li>Big userbase / community.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Picking Angular means you're learning Angular the framework instead of
          how to solve problems in JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          Violates separation of concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Too much magic
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides very little structure
        </li>
      </ol>
