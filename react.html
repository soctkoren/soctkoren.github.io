      <h1>React JS</h1>
      <p>The hot new framework from Facebook</p>

    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Blindly re-render without worrying about DOM thrashing,
        </li>
        <li>
          Their virtual DOM also resolves issues with eventing across browsers by abstracting it to a standards-compliant event-emitting/bubbling model.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's just a view layer, not a complete framework.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The template syntax and the way you create DOM (with JSX) is a bit odd
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want really finite and explicit control over how things get applied to the DOM you don't really have it anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
          While you can just re-render the entire react view, depending on the complexity of component, it sure seems like there can be a lot of diffing to do.
        </li>
      </ol>
